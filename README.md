### My learnings

useRef hook is used to directly create a reference to the DOM element in the functional component. The useRef returns a mutable object. The value is persisted and can be accessed from the current property of the returned object. The object can persist a value for a full lifetime of the component.

#### Tech Stack

React, CSS
